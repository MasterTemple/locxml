Rust + Chumsky
I am creating an XML parser that will let me effeciently traverse the tree in specific ways optimal for my use cases.
My goal is to convert between the following:
- EPUB CFI (at least the sub-path for this XML document)
- XPath (with character offsets where an entity is length 1; I am choosing this because that is how the Browser Range API calculates it),
- Line column pair of an XML file (trivial from byte index)
- Byte index (usize) of an XML file

The idea is that given one of the above locations, I will find the corresponding byte index range, and then convert it into the alternate location

I am at the stage where I have constructed an initial XML tree, but I want the tree to be optimal for this.

Here is what I was thinking:

- I just need to store the spans of each open/close tag pair, each self-closing tag, each entity (since entities only count as 1 character), and each text node.
- I also store some spans related to parsing later

For example: I store the span of the attributes in a tag (all together with 1 span)
- Note: This is without any surrounding padding: padding is managed by the parent who can calculate it from the difference of 2 spanned elements (or from fixed offsets that can never be padded)
I store the span because I don't need to create a map for most of the elements' attributes
However, when I want to, I can parse the slice that corresponds to the attributes, given the spans and the source
Since my parsers are the same, then I know that the parse will always succeed
See `./src/xml/parts/attributes.rs` for context


There is other data I need to parse beyond the spans, such as tag names.
I don't want to do this all upfront, only as needed
However, I don't want to redo/re-parse what has already been parsed

To do this effeciently, I think this would result in me creating 2 trees
This also means I am creating 2 structs: one that is just the spans, the other that is parsed

Alternatively, it could be 1 tree each storing something like this
```rust
pub enum ParseEntry<E: FromParsedSpan> {
    // Wrap in a box to keep enum size small
    Parsed(Box<E>),
    Unparsed(E::Span),
}
```

Either way, I still have the `FromParsedSpan` trait

Instructions:

1. Implement the tree (or trees) with lazy, cached full-parsing
2. Implement optimal traversals to get the data necessary for constructing the XPATH range (just use tag/element type and count) or EPUB CFI (no assertions needed, just the ints, with an optional character offsets)

Other Notes:

1. I am using a custom `Span` type because `SimpleSpan` doesn't have a nice constructor, and allegedly `std::ops::Range` holds an iterator, but please improve this as you see fit

2. I have not yet implemented processing instructions, the xml declaration, cdata, and comments, but I will do so later

3. Correct me where I am making mistakes or poor design choices.
Improve my code and make it more ergonomic.

4. Find common pitfalls and things I need to look out for in my project, and pre-emptively resolve them (add comments explaining your actions)
